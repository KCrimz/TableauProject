<p>First choose an area you want to use for your airbnb analysis! Make sure to get the calendar, listings, and reviews csv files. Combine the CSV files into an excelfile (.xlsx). Then we connect this file with tableau to the Join listings to Calendar using the Id from listings and Listing ID from calendar as show below </p> <img src="https://imgur.com/kHS7Cf2.gif"/>

<p> Create different layouts of data in tableau to the needed poarameters. In these examples the 1st is a price per zipcode on average, 2nd is a visual ization of the zipcodes on the map with the average prices, 3rd is Revenu over the course of a year, 4th the average price per bedroom, 5th the number of distinct listings per bedroom type, and lastly everything put together!</p><img src="https://imgur.com/uZxVMLr.gif"/><img src="https://imgur.com/9OISOLi.gif"/><img src="https://imgur.com/uwMhMtW.gif"/><img src="https://imgur.com/CD8i4tE.gif"/><img src="https://imgur.com/mzGxnqN.gif"/><img src="https://imgur.com/gpjezwn.gif"/>
