<h2>Walk Through:</h2>
<p>First choose an area you want to use for your airbnb analysis! I personally choose Broward County, Florida, United States. Make sure to get the calendar, listings, and reviews csv files. Then we are go;ing to go into python to combine the 3 into 1 larger file for ease of use. Make sure to have pandas installed for python ( commadn prompt run "pip install pandas").  Have all your csv in the same folder (only the ones being combined) and the structure is the same for each.</p>
